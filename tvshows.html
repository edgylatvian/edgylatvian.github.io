		<h1> Parks and Recreation </h1>  
			<p class="text1"> You have probably watched The Office (American version) <br>
				and though that's as far as comedy can go, that there's nothing better. <br> 
				Well, I have good news for you... Parks and Recreation has everything <br> 
				that The Office has to offer AND more. Crazy right? The characters are <br>
				all different and funny in their own way and throughout the 7 seasons <br>
				I guarantee you'll get to love all of them and be sad that the show is over. <br> 
				Take a look bellow for a quick season 1 trailer. It gets better each season too.</p> <br> <br>

		<h1> Sense8 </h1> 		
			<p class="text1"> "I feel you" is something that can be said if you've been in a similar situation <br>
				with someone else, or you're just an emphatic person. Well, now imagine literally feeling <br> 
				someone elses pain in the stomatch after a bad burrito, butterflies in your stomatch <br> 
				when you fall in love, or even physical sensation of actually taking a bullet for someone else  <br>
				or rather sharing the bullet with someone else. This phenomenon is extensevly explored in Sense8. <br>
				The TV Show is about 8 individuals who have their senses merged together, they can feel each <br> 
				other when they feel like it, they can visit each other when they feel like it... <br>
				they can access knowledge of each other when they feel like it. Check it out bellow.</p> <br> <br>
